# Final-Year-Project-
## Analysis of Self Driving Car using Densenet Architecture. 

Our objective was to build a self driving car model that works better than the NVidia model . We have used the Udacity Self Driving car simulator to generate data for our project.
We built a model using densenet architecture and also the Nvidia Model . We then compared the result by using the same data on both the models. We got a slightly better accuracy than the Nvidia Model.

### Result Video 
We have also prepared a video showing the results on the test data.
